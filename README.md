Frontend for the openrecord platform.

The app is currently built in [React](https://reactjs.org/) & [Redux](https://redux.js.org/). 

## Local Development

To set up your local development, make sure you have Node.js version 8 or above installed.

```bash
npm install     # Install packages
npm start       # Run the frontend locally
```

#### Webpack & SCSS

This codebase uses [Webpack 4](https://webpack.js.org/) to bundle modules and generate static assets. It uses [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) as a CSS preprocessor for enabling the use of CSS variables, nesting, mixins, and inheritance.
